<p>
    The parasite script is the main script in charge for your development and deployment process.
</p>
<p>
    It mainly uses the Gulp build system in order to perform its tasks.
</p>
<p>
    Running <code>parasite</code> or <code>parasite --help</code> will display all of the available options.
</p>
<p>
    The flow of the development process is as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>parasite dev</code>: you should run this in the background in order to support the development environment.
            If you prefer, you can use <code>parasite dev-server</code>, which also runs the server
            (if you use an IDE capable of running the server, it'll be more convenient using the IDE, as you can debug the server side code using breakpoints).
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>parasite test</code>: you can run the tests any time you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <code>parasite deploy</code>: deploy the master branch into the production parasite server.
                At the end of the deployment process, if all goes well (pulling the code in parasite, building, running tests),
                the <code>deploy</code> script is run. You should put there any code which should execute in order to update
                the server.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
