    The parasite site can operate in two modes - development mode and production mode.
</p>
<p>
    When running it on your local machine, you should be in development mode.
</p>
<p>
    When running the site in the production parasite server, it is running in production mode.
</p>
<p>
    The main differences between the modes are:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        dev
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            <code>dev</code> is a const defined in the <code>core.dev</code> angular module.
            When true we're on development mode, and when false - production mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <dev-a dev-ref="../parasite script">parasite script</dev-a>, using Gulp, takes care of production vs development for you. All you have to do is run <code>parasite dev</code> / <code>parasite prod</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When running <code>parasite prod</code>, the file prod_mode.js is injected to the final html file.
        </p>
        <p>
            When running <code>parasite dev</code>, the file dev_mode.js is injected to the final html file, as well as dev_services.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            prod_mode.js and dev_mode.js define the const <code>dev</code> to be true / false.
        </p>
        <p>
            In development mode, dev_services.js is injected as well. This file should include all the consts and services that you need during the development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to make sure things don't break in production, you must include the same consts and services in prod_mode.js, or in production angular will complain it fails to inject them.
            <br />
            So you should define a production equivalence of them, e.g.:
            <br />
            <code>const('mock', false)</code>.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        URLs
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            In production mode, the host name defines the current application, e.g. - http://APP_NAME makes APP_NAME the current application.
        </p>
        <p>
            In development mode, the host name doesn't change (as we develop at 127.0.0.1). Therefore, the current application is defined by using the URL, e.g. - http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/APP_NAME.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>ParasiteURL</code> service is responsible for choosing the right representation, based on the <code>dev</code> const.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a consequence, the server side shouldn't contain any logic handling the URL representation - this should be left to the client side (e.g. - don't redirect to http://APP_NAME/&lt;something&gt;, as it won't work in development mode).
        </p>
