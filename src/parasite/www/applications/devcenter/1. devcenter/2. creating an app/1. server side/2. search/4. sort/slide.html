<p>
    The <dev-a dev-ref="/parasite core/search">Search</dev-a> angular service is used in the client side in order to get and set the field by which to make the sort.
</p>
<p>
    The client side <dev-a dev-ref="../../../the application">application object</dev-a> should use it and send it to the server side REST API (or do the sorting in the client side if it's possible).
</p>
<p>
    In the server side you should just get the sort field name from the URL, and do the sorting...
