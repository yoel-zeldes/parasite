    An application can support search. If it supports it, the parasite framework automatically puts a search bar (using select2) with autocomplete for the search options.
</p>
<p>
    The search query contains search items. Each search item contains a filter, an operator and a value, e.g - <code>ID = 123</code> is translated to <code>filter = "ID"</code>, <code>operator = "="</code>, <code>value = "123"</code>
</p>
<p>
    The user can search for multiple search items in his query.

    Parasite takes care for a lot of things for you - including the GUI, the client side code, and the server side code.
    <br />
    The flow of searching is as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The user starts typing his search query. Parasite provides autocomplete of the search items based on the search options your application provides.
        </li>
        <li>
            The user finishes typing the search query, and hits the search button.
            <br />
            Parasite automatically calls the application's <code>getNavigationModel</code> function (with <code>update</code> as true) in order to construct the navigation model based on the search query.
            <br />
            You should handle this query both in the client side (read more about it at <dev-a dev-ref="../../../the application">the application</dev-a> section), and in the server side.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The user can also perform sort (if supported by the navigation plugin. The table navigation plugin for instance supports it).
    In order to support it, you should both support it in the client side in <dev-a dev-ref="../../../the application">the application</dev-a>, as well as in the server side.
