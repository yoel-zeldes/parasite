<p>
    As opposed to the <code>UtilsPlugins</code>'s abstract plugins, the general purpose plugins introduced here are fully working plugins.
</p>
<p>
    In order to use them in your new amazing app, you just need to reference them from your application object,
    as stated in <dev-a dev-ref="/creating an app/the application">the application</dev-a> section.

<dl>
    <dt>
        tree
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The tree is a navigation plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            It consists out of a beautifully crafted d3.js tree.
            <br />
            The root of the tree is the root of the navigation tree - <code>Navigation.currentNavigationModel()</code>.
            <br />
            The navigation model's nodes ids are displayed in the tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a lot of heavy-weight functionality in this plugin, and explaining the code is more complicated than just looking at it...
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing to notice is that the plugin's implementation has to keep information about each node. To do so, the plugin stores the info in the nodes themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't a recommended thing to do, but if you must make the navigation node objects dirty, make sure you do it in your own namespace (the tree uses the tree namespace - the info about a node is stored in node.tree).
        </p>

    <dt>
        table
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The table is a navigation plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            It displays the navigation model in a tabular format: each row displays data about a single node.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model has a tree structure, so this plugin only shows the kids of a single node.
            <br />
            The user can drill into the model - by double clicking a node in the table, its kids will now be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This plugin uses the application's <code>getVisualization</code> function in order to display extended info about each node (this data is displayed in each row's cells).
            <br />
            In addition, this plugin uses pagination - if there are too many kids, only a part of them will be displayed to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            One should use this plugin whenever the navigation tree hierarchy is too big and relatively flat.
            In this situation the tree fails for two reasons
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The UI rendering might get stuck, as there are too many elements to be drawn in the tree.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even if doesn't get stuck, the UX is bad: the user will get a hard time navigating through the tree.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The table plugin solves this problem by splitting a node's kids to pages, and only one page is visible at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with the tree case, in order to understand the table plugin, it's much simpler to read the code itself.
        </p>

    <dt>
        circles
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The circles is a navigation plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to use it, the items of the navigation nodes should have a <code>size</code> field (or some of the items at least, as described below).
        </p>
        <p>
            This plugin gives a different navigation UX.
            the nodes hierarchy is represented as nested circles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The size of each circle is proportional to the size of the node's item.
            If the size isn't defined, it will sum the sizes of the node's kids, and set it as the new size (this is a recursive process).
        </p>
        <p>
            This visualisation gives a feeling of the interactions between the nodes, e.g: bigger circle might be more important than smaller ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application constructing the navigation model should put into the <code>size</code> field something which makes sense to the application.
