<p>
    There are various directives we've already built for your use.
    <br />
    Whenever you need a directive, first look here.
    <br />
    If the utils library doesn't have it (and you think it should), we encourage you to write the directive in a good, readable and reusable way, and add it to the utils (so others will benefit from it as well).

<dl>
    <dt>
        para-stretch
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            It makes sure the element's height is adjusted according to the available space:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the browser window's height gets bigger, the element will be stretched to fill in the space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the browser window's height gets smaller, the element will be shrinked so the window won't have a scrollbar.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This directive should be used by elements inside a plugin's template in two cases:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When an element in the template might be two tall and we fear that the window will have a scrollbar.
                    This isn't a desired user experience, and para-stretch should be used in order to avoid it
                    (see the para-scrollbar directive for a solution for viewing the element's content that gets hidden because of the shrink).
                </li>
                <li>
                    When an element can get along with any available height, and the taller it gets the better it looks to the user
                    (the circles navigation plugin is a good example for it).
                    <br />
                    para-stretch makes sure your element will get as big as possible, so it looks awesome.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The available space is calculated by comparing the total height of the plugin's template to the available browser window height.
            <br />
            As a consequence, if the plugin contains elements which are positioned outside of the flow (e.g by using absolute positioning), they aren't considered part of the plugin's height.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only one para-stretch directive is permitted per plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: this directive won't work on elements such as span. Use div instead.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-scrollbar
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            In coordination with the para-stretch directive, this directive is responsible for displaying a slick and beautiful scrollbar over the para-stretch element whenever its content doesn't fit to the browser window, and is shrunk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most cases, whenever one uses the para-stretch directive, the para-scrollbar directive should be used as well.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-tooltip
    </dt>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            The text used by this attribute will appear as a bootstrap tooltip whenever the user hovers over the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this attribute changes (e.g. by using an angular expression), the tooltip changes accordingly.
        </p>
    <dd>

    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-multi-selection, para-master-select, para-select
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            These directives cooperate together in order to give a multi-selection experience.
            <br />
            para-master-select and para-select must be nested within a para-multi-selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each para-select creates a checkbox.
            <br />
            The para-master-select creates a checkbox which controls all of the para-select in a two-way manner:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Checking / clearing the para-master-select will check /clear all of the para-select.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Selecting / clearing all of the para-selects will select /clear the para-master-select.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Selecting only a number of the para-selects will cause the para-master-select to transfer to an intermediate state.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-toggle-button
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It creates a toggle button with state bound to the para-state attribute.
            <br />
            One should pass in to the para-state an object with a <code>state</code> field.
            <br />
            The state field is two-way linked to the button's toggle state.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-pretty-toggle
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It creates a toggle button with state bound to ng-model.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also supports an <code>activated</code> attribute:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If this attribute's expression evaluates to true, the button will support highliting visual effects (triggered in mouse hover).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this attribute's expression evaluates to false, when the user hovers over the button it won't visually respond.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-loading-button
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an attribute on a button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value of this attribute should be an angular expression.
            <br />
            Once this expression is evaluated to true, the button will change to a loading button, meaning - it's content will change to a rotating loading icon.
            <br />
            Once the expression is evaluated to false, the loading animation stops, and the original content is restored.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-pagination
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It enables a basic pagination, e.g - one can split a big list using this directive.
            <br />
            Its visual appearance is a row of buttons - each represents a page.
            Clicking on it will change the state of the directive (the <code>current</code> attribute which is described later is changed).
            One can watch on the current page value, and display the appropriate data to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following attributes are used by the directive:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>pages</code>: the number of pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>current</code>: an object which should have a <code>page</code> field.
                    This field is two-way linked to current page the user has chosen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>window</code>: the number of buttons the pagination directive has.
                    <br />
                    If <code>pages > window</code>, the most left and right buttons will have an arrow icon on them (meaning - there are more pages).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-file-modal
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It simply uses a template to create a bootstrap modal element with a visual UX appropriate for displaying a file contents.
        </p>
        <p>
            It supports the following attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>title</code>: the title of the modal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>path</code>: the path of the file.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The contents of the file should be nested inside of the directive (these will be displayed in the modal's body).
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to show the modal, one should give an id to the element, and then display the modal using the regular bootstrap way (either by using a link to it or by using the JavaScript API).
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-crop
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be used whenever you've got a one line of text which is too long to be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This directive crops the text and appends ellipsis.
            In order to view the original text, the user can hover over the text, and a tooltip with the original text will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It supports the following attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>text</code>: the text to be displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>limit</code>: the number of characters to display. Any character beyond this limit will be cropped.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        para-pie
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This directive is used as an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            It displays a pie chart.
            <br />
            When some slice is hovered / clicked its information is displayed in the center of the pie.
        </p>
        <p>
            It expects to find in the <code>slices</code> attribute an array of slice objects. Each slice has the following fields:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>title</code>: the title of the slice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>size</code>: the size of the slice. Can be any positive number (integer or float).
                    The sum of all of the slices' sizes don't have to add up to any specific number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>textPrefix</code>, <code>textSuffix</code>: these are used to construct the text that will be displayed in the center of the pie: <code>textPrefix + size + textSuffix</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>
