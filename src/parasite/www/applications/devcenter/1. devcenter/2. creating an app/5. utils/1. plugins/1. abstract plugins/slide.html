<p>
    The utils library contains basic plugin objects which can be extended in order to create a new plugin.
</p>
<p>
    These live in the <code>UtilsPlugins</code> provider (under the <code>utils</code> module)
</p>
<p>
    The following plugins are provided:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        LimitedKidsPlugin
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This plugin should be used by plugins that can't support too many kids:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>canHandle</code> is implemented by this plugin in a way that tests if the current node's number of kids exceeds the limit (by default: 1000).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the limit is exceeded, canHandle returns false, and as stated in <dev-a dev-ref="/creating an app/the plugins">the plugins</dev-a> section, the next plugin's contents will be displayed to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            This plugin should be used (extended actually) when the navigation model could potentially be really large (and flat). Why? for two reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Having too many kids isn't UX-friendly - the user can't really navigate between thousands of kids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Responsiveness: if there are too many kids your plugin might make the site not responsive (or even crash), due to a too big DOM for the browser to handle.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
