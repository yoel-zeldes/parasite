<p>
    The utils library contains some basic angular filters.
</p>
<p>
    Although they are very simple, it's encouraged to use them whenever possible, as they give a unified UX with predefined conventions
    (e.g. if your application needs to display a date, the parseDate filter should be used, as it uses a format used through all of the applications, and it gives a unified UX).
</p>
<p>
    The following filters are provided:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        parseDate
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This filter gets an integer of the number of seconds (as opposed to the number of milliseconds which the angular date filter expects).
            <br/>
            If given undefined or null, the result is "-".
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        roundFloat
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This filter gets a float and gets rid of all of the digits right to the decimal dot except for two.
            <br/>
            This filter should be used whenever displaying float numbers to the user, while their exact value isn't important (e.g. - if you want to display the value of pi, don't use this filter).
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        percents
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This filter is the same as the roundFilter, except it returns a string followed by "%".
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        titleCase
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This filter gets a string and capitalizes the first letter of every word.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>
