<p>
    There are conventions of how you should call your files.
    Some are only conventions (so all the applications will have the same file names), and some are necessary for the site to work properly.
</p>
<p>
    Your application's files should reside in a directory named after the application's name, under <code>src/parasite/www/applications</code>.
    This directory should contain:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A file named <code>module.js</code>.
        This file should contain only angular modules definitions used by your application (<code>angular.module('APP_NAME.app', []);</code>).
        <br />
        Building the site (using the Gulp system, as described in the <dev-a dev-ref="/deployment/parasite script">parasite script</dev-a> section) makes sure to include these files first (as angular modules must be defined before using them).
        <br />
        This is the only convention which is mandatory. If your application doesn't declare any modules, this file isn't needed (but it's a bad practice - every application should have its own modules).
    </li>
    <li>
        A file named <code>app.js</code>.
        This file should only register the <code>Application</code> object (discussed at <dev-a dev-ref="../the application">the application</dev-a> section).
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If your application has its own plugins (discussed at <dev-a dev-ref="../the plugins">the plugins</dev-a> section), they should reside in a directory named <code>plugins</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a good practice that this directory will have its own <code>module.js</code> file, which defines the angular modules used by the plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every plugin should have a directory named after the plugin name. This directory should contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A file named <code>plugin.js></code>. All this file should do is register the plugin object.
            </li>
            <li>
                A file named <code>plugin.html</code>. This is the HTML template used by the plugin (referenced by the <code>templateUrl</code> attribute of the plugin object).
            </li>
            <li>
                A file named <code>XXX_controllers.js</code> which defines the plugin's controllers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If your application contains server side REST API, you should have a directory named <code>data</code>. It should contain:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>services.js</code> file: this file contains an angular service which is responsible for accessing the server (e.g. - by using the <code>$resource</code> service).
                <br />
                This file is the client side API of the server side REST API. Your client side code should use this service to get data from the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>model.js</code> file: should contain the objects which are returned from the <code>services.js</code> file.
                This code doesn't access the server. If an object needs to access the server,
                it should
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Receive the service instance from <code>services.js</code> in the constructor (and the function in <code>services.js</code> which creates that object should pass itself to the constructor).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Or, inject the service defined in <code>services.js</code> and use it directly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you want to support mocks, <code>services.js</code> shouldn't access the server directly.
                    Instead, it should use some other service which either access the server, or creates mock objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of <code>services.js</code> is to create the objects declared in <code>model.js</code> from the response it receives from the underlying service which accesses the server / creates mocks - this response should be a simple JSON.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The underlying service is composed out of three files:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <code>data_retriever.js</code>: this file declares a single service which is injected to <code>service.js</code>.
                                This service will have a simple API which returns JSONs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This file is pretty simple. It should look like
                                <pre>
angular.module('APP_NAME.app')
.service('ApplicationDataRetriever', function($injector, mock) {
    if (mock) {
        return $injector.get('ApplicationDataRetrieverMock');
    }
    else {
        return $injector.get('ApplicationDataRetrieverRest');
    }
});
                                </pre>
                                All this file does is injecting the right service - either a mock one (if the <code>mock</code> angular const is true, which is defined in <code>dev_services.js</code>), or a REST one.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>data_retriever_rest.js</code>: this file should declare a service (in the example above - it's called <code>ApplicationDataRetrieverRest</code>), which simply accesses the server and returns JSONs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>data_retriever_mock.js</code>: this file should declare a service (in the example above - it's called <code>ApplicationDataRetrieverMock</code>), which simply returns pre-made JSONs.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to avoid code duplication, <code>services.js</code> should do all the work which is common to both <code>data_retriever_rest.js</code> and <code>data_retriever_mock.js</code>, e.g. - it should wrap the response in a promise (using <code>$q</code>).
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
