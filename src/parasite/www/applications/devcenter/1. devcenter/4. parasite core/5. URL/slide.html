<p>
    The <code>ParasiteURL</code> service (defined in <code>url_services.js</code>) is responsible for encoding the state of the site in the URL.
    Changing some aspect of the state of the site causes changes in the URL, and changing the URL causes changes in the state.
</p>
<p>
    This service is responsible both for accessing the URL, and for setting the appropriate <code>$watch</code>es so that everything keeps up in sync,
    e.g. - if the user changes the current content plugin, a <code>$watch</code> will be triggered which makes sure to update the URL.
</p>
<p>
    <code>ParasiteURL</code> encodes the following state in the URL:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The current application's name.
        </li>
        <li>
            The current navigation node's id.
        </li>
        <li>
            The index of the navigation plugin the user has selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            The index of the content plugin the user has selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            The search query the user has entered in the search box (if the application enables search).
        </li>
        <li>
            The sort the user has performed.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Although accessing and modifing the site's state is possible using the <code>ParasiteURL</code> service, this is not the recommended way, as it makes testing harder.
    A more appropriate way (whenever possible) is to access the service which is actually responsible for the state, e.g. - Changing the current navigation node should be done
    using the <code>Navigation</code> service . There are situations where using the <code>Navigation</code> service is not an option, e.g. - when the site loads for the first time,
    the URL might contain the id of the navigation node which the user wants to access, so the application writer must access the <code>ParasiteURL</code> service  directly.
</p>
<p>
    Accessing all of these is documented in the code itself.
