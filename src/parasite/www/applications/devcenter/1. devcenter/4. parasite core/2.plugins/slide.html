<p>
    The <code>plugins_services.js</code> file provides the <code>Plugins</code> provider.
    This provider is used both at config time in order to create new plugins,
    and in run time in order to access the plugins.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        config
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The <code>Plugins</code> provider should be injected (using angular DI) to a <code>config</code> block, or to other providers.
        The provider has two properties:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>NavigationPlugin</code>: this "class" (using the <code>class.js</code> package) is the base class used to create new navigation plugins.
                You should refer to <dev-a dev-ref="/creating an app/the plugins">the plugins</dev-a> section in order to learn about this object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ContentPlugin</code>: this "class" is the base class used to create new content plugins.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        run
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Once angular enters the run phase, the <code>Plugins</code> provider binds each plugin configuration (defined on the application objects) to its matching plugin object.
            This is done by matching the plugin configuration's <code>pluginId</code> to the plugin's <code>id</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a match is found, the plugin configuration object gets a <code>plugin</code> property holding the plugin, and <code>canHandle</code> property which is the plugin's <code>canHandle</code> function (unless the plugin configuration has defined the function by itself).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>Plugins</code> provider should be injected (using angular DI) to a <code>run</code> block, or to other services.
            The provider has several properties, all of which are documented in the service code itself.
