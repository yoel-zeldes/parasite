    The <code>Search</code> service provides access to the search the user has entered, as well as to the sort he has performed.

    Changing one of them results in updating the navigation model (the current application's <code>getNavigationModel</code> is called. It's up to the application to consider the search and sort queries using this service in order to construct the appropriate navigation model).
