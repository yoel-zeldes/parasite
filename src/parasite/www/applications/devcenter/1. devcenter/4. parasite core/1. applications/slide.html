<p>
    The <code>applications_services.js</code> file provides the <code>Applications</code> provider.
    This provider is used both at config time in order to create a new application,]
    and in run time in order to access the applications.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        config
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The <code>Applications</code> provider should be injected (using angular DI) to a <code>config</code> block, or to other providers.
        The provider has two properties:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Application</code>: this "class" (using the <code>class.js</code> package) is the base class used to create new applications.
                You should refer to <dev-a dev-ref="/creating an app/the application">the application</dev-a> section in order to learn about this object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>register</code>: use this function in order to register an instance of the application class you created.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        run
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The <code>Applications</code> provider should be injected (using angular DI) to a <code>run</code> block, or to other services.
        The provider has two properties:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>applications</code>: this function returns an Array of all of the applications registered in the config phase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>currentApplication</code>: a function which either returns the application the user is using (if called with no argument),
                or if called with an argument - set the current application to the given application.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
